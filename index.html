                <p>40% of all food in the United States is wasted.  As hardworking adults it is hard to find time to plan and cook a full meal each week without wasting part of your in house food items. Here are some stats on food waste in America:</p>

                <p>1. Took out the feature of food items being stored in fridge, freezer, or pantry.

                </p>
                <p>We found users felt it was unecessary and too confusing to have the food items go to specific destinations. Allowing them to just add the food item directly to one main storage unit still functions efficiently, but without the confusion for the user.</p>

                <p class="stand">We came up with future additions to make our application come more to life. The user will be able to add certain ingredients, from the recipes page, to their grocery list. They then will be able to go into the grocery list feature and organize it out from there. Users will be able to switch the mode of the recipe feature and be able to search a certain recipe and obtain a whole grocery list for that meal. They can add this list under the grocery list feature.

                </p>
                <p class="stand">Overall our project was very exciting to work on. We came up with many solutions to help with the organization of users home-food life. With the time frame given, we got all the way up to a working prototype to showcase one feature, but we still have many improvements to add.</p>
